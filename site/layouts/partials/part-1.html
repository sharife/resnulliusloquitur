		<p>Nonperformance is unconditionally promising to hear something in circumstances where the unforeseeable future is not bracketed, or even accepted, but actively bet on, and as such radically, utterly, transforms the promise of a hearing, whatever is promised in a hearing, and the desire to reduce a hearing into an act. </p>

		<p>What if holding a hearing was all there is? Endless, never arriving at an act. There are no acts for this play, or at least numbered acts we can account for. Legislation never arrives, because the <em>whereas</em> repeats, but still, never to address the question of where here is, <em>eres</em>, are, our. A litany of whereas’s deferring enactment, the preamble is really an ambling liturgy of our shared doing.</p>

		<p>In media res: our new socially mediated reality. Figures stream. Uncut, medial proximity reveals an unlit gap, and this ledge from which we might jump into a virtual intimacy. It captures and frees, convicts and escapes, so many truths harvested, which one will we buy? Believe your eyes, see only what you first saw, even if what was first was always, sur-repetitiously, in media res, being recorded, recording (for) conviction, the point of a needle which does not know it is actually a centripetally gathering line, bumping along toward some non-distant, non-immediate, non-placeable, center of a record so slick its grooves play a music we don’t know we hear until we do.</p>

		<p>I went to an art show and played this record. Its mo(nu)mentum threw every one, thing, note off. First, the bystander’s hand off. Second, the witness’s off-handled recording. Third, the 18 arms, dragging and drawing, circumlocuting an offering, this record. It played: “But I’m still here…”µ looking at these renditions of enforcement. “So call me back” using these destroyed conditions of performativity, with the rubble left in the wake of these regimes of self and evidence. Make something when the swarm of words, letters, sounds, the flock of bodies and papers, the flight of sense and thought, start to land and hover where they will.</p>

		<p>Sign this will. Listening while looking at: everyone looking, some self looking while reading, a non-self looking while writing, someone doing anything. Place this desire. Consent. Inconsist by making whatever self a place of hearing. Wait. Here. A ringing ringing. Truth floats up from the murmur of history and social death, out above the murs of law and justice, this ringing drafts on, in the slipstream of the unconscious. Submit to (a)mur, Lacan says.</p>

		<p>Hear where each one, thing and note is (in) the clear. Pluck this radioscopic bit from the air, and throw it back at the mighty law. Its bulldozing, wordsmithing, incontrovertible scribe leaves nothing to be asked, and nothing to be argued. There is only a rock, abandoned by a child, in the tracks of a tank. It marks a Real no-thing, a rebellion of ten thousand mouths filling the mis-n’en-scene of law with alyrical notes. Res nullius loquitur. There in a written aside, as a procedural oversight, on the law’s underside, the antinomial word proves that poetry is the only written form capable of justice. This is a promise. A possible nonperformance of antinomosian parletre. The inkblock always runs black.</p>

		<p>A trace breath is left in the running line. Even its end, its disappearance in its own finite fluidity, is part of this trace. Ends do not justify origins, and so for any origin to be just, they must find some way to avow the force of myth. Brandish mystical foundations against mythical origins until the two can no longer be distinguished from each other. Until the lids of the eyes sound words, and the lips of the mouth visualize objects. Until the non-scene of mythical origin overtakes the not-enough of law’s origin. Until that mystical non(self)substantiating presences become more real than any mythological narrative or legal reform could ever promise. Listen, like a transubstantial realist, to that Zong!, song, psalm thing. <em>Res nullius loquitur</em>.</p>
