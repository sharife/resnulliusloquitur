		<p class="hideme">In a description of the cell where Bland was found dead, the state’s investigation includes a citation to what might have been the last words she read. </p>

		<p class="hideme"><blockquote>The shelf/table attached to the south wall and to the west of this bunk contained two books, one titled ‘101 Ways to Find God’s Purpose in Your Life’ and the other was titled ‘God’s Word’, or a Bible. The Bible was opened to pages 428-429, Psalms 119-122. Investigator PARINELLO informed Ranger ELLISON that he had already moved the two books while looking for any handwritten notes left by BLAND. The Bible had been found open on the aforementioned pages and the other book was closed.<sup>15</sup></blockquote></p>

		<p class="hideme">Psalm 119 is a curious form of physical evidence. One of the longest chapters in the Bible, it is a prayer dedicated to the Torah or written word of God. It draws our attention to another realm of knowing tied to another order of submission, compliance and obedience to authority through writing, the word, and the status of the letter.</p>

		<p class="hideme">The Psalms as song or liturgy is inseparable from the ritual context of the book. But it points not to some divine law, but a fabricated, performed, shown <em>doing</em> in response to Bland’s question about how “failing to signal turned into all this.” This doing, a <em>loquitur</em>, in and by the evidence, emerges from a <em>res nullius</em>, a non-self, for we ultimately do not know who opened the book, and by whom or whether it was read at all, except by those following this signifying chain. </p>

		<p class="hideme"><em>Res nullius</em>, unhived, traceless never-leaving, anatta, apophatic thing.</p>

		<p class="hideme">Psalm, song, law, <em>loquitur</em>: texts to be nonsilently read and aurally interpreted. </p>

		<p class="hideme"><em>Murmur</em> is the English word Robert Alter uses to translate from the Hebrew word <em>hagah</em>, which means, “to make a low muttering sounds, which is what one does with a text in a culture where there is no silent reading.”<sup>16</sup></p>

		<p class="hideme">The trail of evidence Bland left with these specific Psalms suggests the importance of listening for this murmuring. It vocalizes a teaching, and so desire: an ongoing, concrete promise in a libidinal mode of “rebellion” and “rescue” in “the here and now”<sup>17</sup> of the physical world.</p>

		<p class="hideme">The compelled aurality of these evidence effect, through familiar imagery and language, the extremities of legal reason and enforcement endured “countermythologically”.<sup>18</sup></p>

		<p class="hideme">Lyric-like, aural evidence murmurs that which cannot be directly said or thought. And whatever your listening catches concretizes something more real in the evidence than what self-evident judgement can ever know. </p>

		<p class="hideme">Murmuring itself, <em>res nullius loquitur</em>, is the essence of our desire within law.</p>

		<p class="hideme">Bland murmurance loops and surrounds.</p>
